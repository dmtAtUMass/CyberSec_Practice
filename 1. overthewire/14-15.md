The program requires us to paste the previous password into localhost port 30000

So I used netcat to connect with this port

```
nc localhost 30000
```

and pasted the previous password in:

```
jN2kgmIXJ6fShzhT2avhotn4Zcka6tnt
```

And the server responses:

```
Correct!
jN2kgmIXJ6fShzhT2avhotn4Zcka6tnt

```

Password is: jN2kgmIXJ6fShzhT2avhotn4Zcka6tnt
