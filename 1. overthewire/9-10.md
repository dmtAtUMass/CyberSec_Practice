log in to the file, and find data.txt

I first tried to cat data.txt

Apparently this is a binary file and most of it is not human readable

So I tried 

```
cat data.txt | grep "="
```

which doesn't work either, returning: 

```
bandit9@bandit:~$ cat data.txt |grep "="
grep: (standard input): binary file matches
```

so I did some searches and found another way to cat a file and grep a pattern, which is using "strings"

```
strings data.txt | grep "="
```

returns:

```
bandit9@bandit:~$ strings data.txt | grep "="
