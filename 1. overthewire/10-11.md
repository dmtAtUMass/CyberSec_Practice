Log in to the repository, and ls, we get a file data.txt

VGhlIHBhc3N3b3JkIGlzIDZ6UGV6aUxkUjJSS05kTllGTmI2blZDS3pwaGxYSEJNCg==
```

Having done some CTFs before, I saw that the "==" at the end of the string signifies a base64 pattern, 

So I run a base64 decoder and got: 

```
The password is 6zPeziLdR2RKNdNYFNb6nVCKzphlXHBM
```

And that's a statement!
