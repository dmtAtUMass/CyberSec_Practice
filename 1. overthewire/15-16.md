For this level, I first used netcat command to communicate with the server

so 
```
nc --ssl localhost 30001
```

It turns out this is an invalid option. So I looked for a newer command, the ncat.

and we have:

```
nc --ssl localhost 30001
```

paste the previous password in, we receive the password for our last problem:
