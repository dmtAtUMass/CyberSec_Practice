Log in to the problem

```
ls

```
, we obtain a file called
```
sshkey.private
```
we will need to use this file to login to the server

Now when I first tried: 

```
ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost
```

, it returns: 

```
!!! You are trying to log into this SSH server on port 22, which is not intended.

bandit14@localhost: Permission denied (publickey).
```

I also sees that the program tried to establish a server on MY IP, not the game's IP

So I figured that the localhost is actually a catch here, and tried: 

```
ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

And then answered "yes"

This gave me sign in to the bandit14 user.

I then cat:

```
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
```


I got:  fGrHPx402xGC7U7rXKDaxiWFTOiF0ENq
